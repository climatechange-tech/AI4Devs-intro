- It consists of a small front-end project in HTML5 and JavaScript, in which we create a web application. I'll give you the details.

1: The main container box will be placed at the center of the page, both vertically and horizontally; 2: Above the main box, write a HTML5's h1-styled title that reads 'Simple String Reverser'; inside of the box: 3.1: Design a form to introduce a string, where the default string (in light gray) will read 'Test string', and including a button right after the form with text 'Reverse' (white bold letters and green background colour); 3.2: Slightly above the form, write a text saying 'Enter a string:', where its left margin is aligned with the left edge of the form; 3.3 Below the elements described at points 3.1 and 3.2, there is a label "Reversed string", also aligned with the leftmost edge of the form at point 3.1; 3.4; Place a text box in blank right below the label at point 3.3.

Now, regarding technical details, the page will invert the input string when the user clicks the button 'Reverse' and the reversed string will appear inside the text box mentioned at point 3.4. Generate a single html file called 'index.html' and another file written in JavaScript, called 'script.js'.

- Many thx, bud. Now, in order to make a deeper impact, can you please: 1: Invert the colour of every single element, i.e. mimic dark mode; 2: Transfer styling elements in the HTML file, to a separate CSS file.
